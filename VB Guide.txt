Note to self while using 
VB:
1)
i. To Change the Form name, you must click the form and change the name at the (Name) section
ii. Then go to the 'File Properties' at the bottom right to change the whole Windows form name to the same name given at the (Name) section at the beningging.
iii. Then error will occur, hopefully. Then go to the error code line and change the 'Form1' to the name given in (Name)
iv. And hopefully... it will be fine.

#save everything after you go step after step. [Ctrl + S]

2) Set the form to start up at CenterScreen
